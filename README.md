### Brief

In word search puzzles you get a square of letters and have to find specific
words in them.

For example:

```text
jefblpepre
camdcimgtc
oivokprjsm
pbwasqroua
rixilelhrs
wolcqlirpc
screeaumgr
alxhpburyi
jalaycalmp
clojurermt
```

There are several programming languages hidden in the above square.

Words can be hidden in all kinds of directions: left-to-right, right-to-left,
vertical and diagonal.

Given a puzzle and a list of words return the location of the first and last
letter of each word.

## Exception messages

Sometimes it is necessary to raise an exception. When you do this, you should include a meaningful error message to
indicate what the source of the error is. This makes your code more readable and helps significantly with debugging. Not
every exercise will require you to raise an exception, but for those that do, the tests will only pass if you include
a message.

To raise a message with an exception, just write it as an argument to the exception type. For example, instead of
`raise Exception`, you should write:

```python
raise Exception("Meaningful message indicating the source of the error")
```

## Running the tests

To run the tests, run `pytest word_search_test.py`

Alternatively, you can tell Python to run the pytest module:
`python -m pytest word_search_test.py`

### Common `pytest` options

- `-v` : enable verbose output
- `-x` : stop running tests on first failure
- `--ff` : run failures from previous test before running other test cases

For other options, see `python -m pytest -h`

### Evaluation Criteria

- Python best practices
- Show us your work through your commit history
- Completeness: did you complete the features? Are all the tests running?
- Correctness: does the functionality act in sensible, thought-out ways?
- Maintainability: is it written in a clean, maintainable way?


### CodeSubmit

Please organize, design, and document your code as if it were going into production - then push your changes 
to the master branch. After you have pushed your code, you may submit the assignment on the assignment page.

All the best and happy coding,
